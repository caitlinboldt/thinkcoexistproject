    <p>People’s park is filled with history. The University of California, Berkeley acquisitioned land for an expansion, a long term plan which would possibly include a playing field, student housing, faulty offices, or parking. The original apartment housing on the property was completely demolished by July of 1968. In March of 1969 the University confirmed its plans to put a playing field for students in the vacant lot. As these plans were going on, the people were making a plan of their own. One which turned the mud lot into a park.</p>

    <p>The people battled the university for the park, including the national guard; the people won. They named the park, People’s park. A place of community, of family and somewhere to feel safe.</p>

    <p>The park creates a sense of security giving a 'we are family' communal identity, being a safe place for all. Food is brought daily by an organization called Food Not Bombs, providing a meal to all those in need. People’s park is different from other parks because of the history, the resources available, the people who created the park, as well as the people who have stayed there and have been going there for years.</p>

    <p>The park was meant to be a place where anyone could go. For all people, from all walks of life, for everybody. The park is about acceptance, about freedom, about the people. </p>
    <p>The history of the park has made the mentality which has been present since the birth of the park until today. If you spend time there you become part of the community and the wonder People's Park has to offer. The homeless there see it as a safe ground and a green haven for when you do not have anywhere to go; you always know you can go there. </p>
